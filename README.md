# project_june
Started as a freelance project in June 2020 for a firm. But I have extended it for further usage. <br>It is using **Django and Pandas**. Pandas is used to validate data in a file, and then the contents are displayed in a html table. 

# Few Operations:
  > Create, Rename and Delete folders. Create Folders inside a Folder<br/>
  > Upload Files to the folders created.<br/>
  > Validate Excel file which has a set of defined columns.<br/>
  > Rename, Replace and Delete Files.<br/>

# Future Upgrades:
  > Dynamic setting of columns for validation.<br/>
  > Assignment of folders to a specific file upload and movement.<br/>
  > Support for CSV.<br/>
  > Move files and folders.<br/>
  > Auto Data Corrections.<br/>
  > Download files and folders in zip format.<br/>
  > User Specific access on operations and events.<br/>
  > Pagination, Breaking and combining huge datasets.<br/>
  > Dashboard for visualization.<br/>
  > Visualization of Data.<br/>
